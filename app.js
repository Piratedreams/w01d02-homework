// 1. Interpolation is inserting values of variables into
// strings to use for console logs.by using `` and ${}.
// const hello = "hello world!";
//
// console.log(`I am thrilled to be around here ${hello}`);
//
//  While Concatenation
// is using strings together with variables.
// const firstName = "Ben";
// const lastName = "wall";
// console.log("Welcome back " + firstName + lastName);


// 2. DRY stands for don't repeat yourself. which is mainly
// to have optimized and clean code so other coders will be
// able to read and understand what you're trying to do.
// Instead of using a While loops for every function. There is
// the For loops which can cut down on code to run faster.


// 3. Defining a variable is declaring it for the first time.
// these will be defined with an initial value to that variable.
// which can be a string or a number.

// 4. A const is used when the value of the variable will not change.
// While it can be modified using that const's name with .push.
// Let is another way of declaring a variable but it's value can be changed
// when it is mentioned throughout the code.

// 5. A parent directory is the directory or folder that hosts other files within its path.
// that can consist of the main project folder being the parent directory
// of the index, css and javascript files for creating a website.

// 6. Within the terminal you can use the command "man" before the command's name
// to have a manual description of what the possibilities of the command holds, along
// with its purpose.

// 7. Tab completion is used to help the user within the terminal to auto fill
// the rest of the object. It streamlines the workflow for going through directories.
// Along with skipping over spelling mistakes that could happen if it was typed.


// 1. a < b
// 2. c > d
// 3. 'name' = 'name'
// 4. a < b < c
// 5. a = a < d
// 6. e = 'Kevin'
// 7. 48 = '48'


1. It's not an infinite loop because there is nothing to check for the loop to repeat.


2. it is  an infinite loop because it only loops while runProgram remains true.
But within the function it will return false but that is within the function staying locally
in the function and will not change the initial value of runProgram keeping it in a loop.

3.
